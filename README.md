# MRI VR Simulation Wiki

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **MRI VR Simulation** project! This project aims to create an interactive **Virtual Reality (VR) simulation** of an **MRI procedure** using **Unity**. The simulation is designed to help students learn and practice the MRI procedure in an immersive and interactive environment, enhancing their understanding and confidence before working with real patients.

## Features
- **Realistic MRI Room Environment** – Modeled to resemble an actual MRI scanning room.
- **Interactive Learning** – Users can interact with MRI controls and receive step-by-step guidance.
- **Simulated Patient Handling** – Learn how to properly position patients for an MRI scan.
- **VR Compatibility** – Supports HTC Vive Focus 3 for an immersive experience.
